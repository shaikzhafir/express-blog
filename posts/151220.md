Quite an interesting throwback to my internship interview question on the best way to shuffle a deck of cards

1) treat cards as an array
2) iterate through the array
3) for every index, generate a random number. swap the values 
of both the index and the random index
4) repeat until every element has swapped at least once, i.e iterate 
through the whole array


*extra  
Instead of iterating throughout the whole array, cut in half 
the array length, since most of the array is already iterated through
